# About the Project

This project is a crawl application that uses SignalR, Selenium, Clean Architecture, React, Typescript, Material UI, Axios and Redux to meet customer requirements. The Crawler is located in the application layer and performs the scraping process using Selenium. An interface is used for sending log messages with SignalR. The necessary codes for sending emails has been written.

Google Login is an authentication method that allows users to log in to your website using their Google accounts. Users can access your website with just a single click using their Google credentials. This method offers several advantages compared to other traditional methods used for member logins or user authentication on your site.


# Redux

Redux is a library used for state management in JavaScript applications. It maintains the application's state in a central store and manages state-changing operations using actions and reducers. This state represents all the data held throughout the application and reflects its current state of operation. By employing Redux, it becomes easier to manage application state, ensuring a more consistent and comprehensible flow of data between components.

In my application, I use Redux to keep track of information like whether the user requested an email address or a download process. Additionally, I use Redux to maintain the notification count for displaying the notification icon within the application.


# Crawler & Live Logs

After the scanning process, information about whether a file will be downloaded or an email will be sent is communicated to our crawler page using Redux. Our scanning process continues based on this information. Once the scanning process starts, the user is directed to the live log screen. On this screen, the product crawling process is monitored in real-time. After the process is completed, we keep track of the notification count using Redux. If the process is completed, a badge with the number "1" appears on the avatar in the app bar.

# Table & Modal

The user's orders are displayed in a table. The products and events related to these orders are shown on the screen using a modal form. The user can delete the orders if desired.


# Excel

We can download our orders as an Excel file. These tables are well-formatted Excel spreadsheets.

Material UI has been used in the project. However, the Material UI appbar has been made transparent, and a custom shape has been designed to replace it. The asymmetrical triangle shape of the navbar has been created by me. To achieve a seamless match with the sharp triangle structure and gradient color of the animated landing page, the following resource has been utilized: https://www.shapedivider.app/

# SignalR

SignalR is a Microsoft technology that enables the creation of real-time web applications. It facilitates communication between the client and the server, allowing for fast updates and interactions. SignalR supports the WebSocket protocol and provides a simplified programming model by abstracting away the complexities of WebSocket usage. This makes it easier to add features such as live chat, real-time updates, and notifications to applications.

# Selenium

Selenium is a popular open-source tool used for automating web application testing and browser automation. It provides a set of APIs and libraries to interact with web browsers. Selenium is compatible with various programming languages and can perform a range of automation tasks such as controlling browsers, simulating user interactions, filling out web forms, and navigating between pages. It offers a powerful tool for developers and testing professionals to test and ensure the reliability of web applications.
